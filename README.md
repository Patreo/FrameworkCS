We first started developing FrameworkCS in 2003 as an exercise to learn .NET and C#. FrameworkCS is a Enterprise and Business Framework implements a lot of features necessary to you can focus on Business and not in repetitive code like access data, authentication, permissions, menus, modules, document management an other stuff. This framework include a all stack from .NET including libraries for reflection, data, web, web mvc, windows forms and XAML. During lastest 13 year we created and changed a lot of 3rd party classes and Libs to include on well organized libraries.

### Where I can find code?
This project is private and only acessible to selected people, source code is available under request in [https://gitlab.com/patreo/csframework](https://gitlab.com/patreo/csframework) account and if you are interested on this project please contact me (pmcfernandes@gmail.com) and tell me why you need this. I will choose if give you access to it.

### It's free
Yes. I choose keep it private for secure reasons, I have 13 years of investment of my time here, I don't want see it abused like another open source projects. if I choose you to be part of my team you will get access to all code and tools.

### Why this repo
I choose keep all code private in another git repo website [https://gitlab.com/patreo/csframework](https://gitlab.com/patreo/csframework) but all Wiki and Issues will be make here, main reason for this decision is github is more notorious, but gitlab is free for private repos.
